**Task Description:**
Create a web application with common features of searching media content, allowing users to search for music, books, and other media using the iTunes Search API. The application should include a search bar and a list of search results.

**Requirements:**

1. **Core Functionality:**

   - Create a page with a search bar.
   - Display search results in a list below the search bar.
   - Connect to and use the iTunes Search API to fetch data (https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1).

2. **Technologies:**

   - **React**: Use functional components and hooks.
   - **TypeScript**: Use TypeScript for components and data typing.
   - **Styling** of your choice (preferably Tailwind or CSS Modules).
     Optional Technologies:
   - **Next.js** with App directory approach.
   - **UI library** of your choice (e.g. shadcn or nextui).

3. **Additional Features (optional but encouraged):**
   - Responsive design for mobile devices.
   - Design/coloring/fonts are up to you, make it unique on your taste.

**Code Requirements:**

- Clean and readable code.
- Adherence to modern React and TypeScript development practices.
- Well-structured file organization.
- Use Git for version control (provide a link to the repository).

**Expected Outcome:**

- Link to a GitHub repository with the completed project.
- Instructions for running the project locally.
- (Optionally) host it on any free hosting platform (e.g. Vercel)

**Evaluation Criteria:**

- Correctness and completeness of the core functionality.
- Use of TypeScript.
- Code quality and readability.
- *Completion speed*: We value timely execution of the task. While code quality is the priority, we appreciate candidates who can demonstrate efficiency in completing the assignment. Faster completion, while maintaining quality, will be considered a strong plus.
- Implementation of additional features.
- Ability to follow instructions and documentation.
- Design/UX, the vision.

**Documentation for Reference:**

- iTunes Search API: [iTunes Search API Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/AudioVideo/Conceptual/iTuneSearchAPI/Searching.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40017632-CH5-SW1)

**Design and Functionality Vision:**

- The list of search results can be presented in any format, including a card list.
- You are encouraged to provide your vision of the functionality and design, as one of the goals of this assignment is to understand your level of design thinking and your ability to make independent decisions.
- Any additional external library can be used if reasonable.

Good luck! We look forward to seeing your solution.
